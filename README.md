LEDOSAmbilight
==============

What is LEDOS?
--------------
LEDOS is a software we are working on for Arduino and ESP8266 that can control an LED strip via multiple interfaces.

What is LEDOS Ambilight?
------------------------
LEDOS Ambilight is a Qt program that communicates with the LEDOS via USB RS232 (Serial) the avarage color on your screen. Thus you can make a really cool ambilight like effect.
LEDOS Ambilight is written in C++ and therefore is much much faster than any alternative written in Processing. In fact LEDOS Ambilight can send colors at `50Hz` without a problem and the LEDOS working on an Arduino Mega can easily cope with that either.

How to use it?
--------------
Well for fucks sake.... There is a GUI! And it only has 2 buttons and a Dropdown menu so you should be able to figure it out.
